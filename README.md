# Wardrobe Weather

Aren't all weather apps really just wardrobe planning apps anyways?

## The project:

For a job interview I was given an assignment to create a "weather widget." Part of the reason I've gravitated toward programming is because I am the living embodiment of DRY practices. In my day-to-day I try to avoid doing any task that might also be included in the activities brochure for an eternal damnation, and as such Sisyphus's plight is never far from mind. Therefore, whenever confronted with mundane work I have a sometimes regrettable habit of trying to wring out a drop of dignity in purpose where there might be precious little. Sometimes it leads nowhere and I end up just pushing that same rock up the hill as everyone else. Other times, after asking a series of Jack Handy-esque, like "what is a weather widget, and why would anyone use it?" I end up in interesting places. This is one of those other times.

## My process

As I'm currently building out a portfolio, I thought it might be neat to give a blow-by-blow accounting of my development process on this simple little app, along with the elapsed time to perform each task. That's the goal anyways, we'll see how it turns out in the end.

### Monday:

Was given project parameters attached below. Have a busy week planned, so I informed recipient that I won't be completing project until weekend. Will use time to mull over ideas that could make this more interesting than surface requirements. For this particular project it should be easy enough to scale back later and revert to status quo concept.

### Saturday 9:30 pm:

Wow this weeks sucked. Anyways, have a bit of time now to spend thinking about this and getting organized. My basic concept for this project is drawn on two primary inspirations:

1. All weather apps are really just clothing selection apps

2. My wife has spent the last two days helping plan her sister's wedding by doodling dress ideas

What I came up with was an idea for a "paper doll" style app that would pull together an svg image of an outfit based on weather forecast conditions.

So my wife and I sat down and made the following chart of temperatures and conditions and what she would wear in each scenario. (15 min)

I then commissioned her to sketch out on tracing paper each clothing item on top of a paper doll template. (1 hr)

While she was sketching I went and did more research on the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/appid). (15 min) And then fired up a github repo and initiated a new vue project for this. (15 min) I contemplated creating the project in react or svelte, and I might still create versions of it in those later, but this particular project is for a vue shop, so I might as well do as the Romans here.

My final act of the night was to sit down and start writing this readme. I tend to take way too much pride in my writing and so it ended up being my lengthiest contribution of the night. (1 hr).

Total elapsed work time:

Me: 1.5 hrs

Wife: 1 hr

### Sunday:
